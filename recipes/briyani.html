    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Chicken Biryani is a rich and aromatic rice dish made by layering marinated chicken with partially cooked 
        basmati rice and slow-cooking it with fragrant spices, herbs, and saffron. 
        The chicken is first marinated in yogurt, spices, and lemon juice to enhance its flavor and tenderness. 
        It’s then cooked with golden fried onions, tomatoes, mint, and coriander to form a flavorful base. 
        Parboiled rice is layered over this chicken masala, and the whole dish is sealed and cooked on low heat 
        (a method called "dum") to let the flavors blend beautifully. 
        Served with raita or boiled eggs, chicken biryani is a hearty and satisfying meal perfect for special occasions or weekend feasts.</p>

    <ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>  
        In a large bowl, mix the chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice.  
        Cover and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for best flavor).
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Cook the Rice:</strong>  
        Boil 6–8 cups of water in a large pot. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamoms, cinnamon stick, and salt.  
        Add the soaked rice and cook until it’s 80% done (the grains should still be slightly firm). Drain and set aside.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Chicken Masala:</strong>  
        Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan. Add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.  
        Add green chilies and ginger-garlic paste, cook for 1–2 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft.  
        Then add the marinated chicken and cook until 90% done. Stir in mint and coriander leaves.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Layer the Biryani:</strong>  
        Lower the heat. Add half of the cooked rice over the chicken masala.  
        Drizzle saffron milk, fried onions, and a little ghee. Add the remaining rice and repeat the toppings.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Dum Cooking (Steam Method):</strong>  
        Cover the pot tightly with a lid or seal it with foil.  
        Place on low heat and cook for 15–20 minutes (you can place a tawa under the pot to prevent burning).  
        Let it rest for 10 minutes before serving.
